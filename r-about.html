                    <h3>Why Invest with us?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are a low risk low return, commission free investment product aimed at people who don’t have aside a budget to invest. Wealth make wealth and we want to make you part of the process. Instead of sitting jobless in a bank account, we want your money to get out in the world, explore it, and and earn more money.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why Invest at all?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A negligible percentage of the American population has any sort of savings or investments. Without these, money only depletes; investing is your opportunity to grow your wealth, and grow it even more. We require you to have absolutely no knowledge of either finance or how the financial markets operate. We simply you provide you with cold hard facts and ask you to base your decisions on them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The downside?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nothing really. The most intuitive downside to investing is risk, and though you might think us naive for claiming no downside, but because of the nature of investments we allow you to make, their is little to no chance of ever losing money.

                    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's free! There is no commission, and no barrier of entry. Everyone is welcome to join and invest at the same level.
                    </p>

                    <h3>I don’t have much money, is this a right fit for me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's perfect for you. Somehow, it's an accepted notion that investing is an activity of the rich. That is the current trend, but it also screams a truth in our faces; investing makes money, that's why rich people indulge in it. We are here to provide you low risk investment options that will slowly, but definitely build your wealth.
