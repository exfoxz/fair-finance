                    <h3>Why Invest at all?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A negligible percentage of the American population has any sort of savings or investments. Without these, money only depletes; investing is your opportunity to grow your wealth. We require you to have absolutely no knowledge of either finance or how the financial markets operate. We simply provide you with cold hard facts and ask you to base your decisions on them.

                    <h3>The Downside?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nothing really. The most intuitive downside to investing is risk, but, because of the nature of investments we allow you to make, their is very little to no chance of major losses.

                        It's perfect for you. Somehow, it's an accepted notion that investing is an activity for the rich. That is the current trend, but it also screams a truth in our faces; investing makes money, it generates wealth. We are here to provide you low risk investment options that will slowly, but definitely build your wealth.
